45 - BOSH deploy
================

This section will show how to deploy a simple manifest to an existing BOSH.

The deployment manifest being used is stored at this gist: https://gist.github.com/drnic/3ff87c465d483543c53d

It deploys a Redis cluster of 3-VMs to a BOSH in a bosh-lite hosted on AWS (which happens to also be running the Concourse being used).

Deploy
------

The `credentials.yml` now needs the target and credentials for a BOSH:

```yaml
---
bosh-target: https://54.2.3.4:25555
bosh-username: admin
bosh-password: admin
bosh-stemcell-name: bosh-warden-boshlite-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent
```

Push the pipeline to Concourse with:

```
./45_*/run.sh credentials.yml
```

Since `bosh deploy` is a no-op if the manifest doesn't change, re-running the pipeline job succeeds:

Notes
-----

For a normal BOSH with built-in SSL, you will need to set `source.ignore_ssl` to `true` in your `bosh-deployment` resource:

```yaml
- name: resource-redis-bosh-deployment
  type: bosh-deployment
  source:
    target: bosh-target
    username: bosh-username
    password: bosh-password
    deployment: redis
    ignore_ssl: true
```
